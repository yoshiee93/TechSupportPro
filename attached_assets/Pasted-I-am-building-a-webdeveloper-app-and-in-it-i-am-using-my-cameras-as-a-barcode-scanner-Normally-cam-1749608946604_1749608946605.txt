I am building a webdeveloper app and in it i am using my cameras as a barcode scanner. 
Normally cameras work well however when accessing the web app via chrome and opening the camera, it appears to be in wideview mode not the standard 1x zoom. 

With samsung phones is there a way to set the camera or zoom from the webapp when opening the camera feature or is there another way todo this, I am building in replit

Great question ‚Äî you're encountering a common limitation when using cameras in mobile browsers via the getUserMedia API. Let's break down the situation and your options.

üîç Problem
When using the web camera on a Samsung phone (or most Androids) via Chrome, the camera defaults to the ultrawide lens or a low zoom/wide FOV (Field of View), which is not ideal for barcode scanning ‚Äî you'd prefer the main (1x) camera.

‚úÖ What You Can Do in a Web App
Use facingMode Constraints (limited)
In getUserMedia(), you can request the rear camera, but you can't explicitly select which rear camera (main vs ultrawide) on most mobile browsers.

javascript
Copy
Edit
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    facingMode: { exact: "environment" }
  }
})
Limitations: On Samsung phones, this often defaults to the ultrawide camera.

Use deviceId to Choose the Main Camera (Semi-Solution)
You can enumerate all available video input devices and attempt to choose the primary rear camera (usually the one with the middle-of-the-road resolution).

javascript
Copy
Edit
const devices = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices();
const videoDevices = devices.filter(device => device.kind === 'videoinput');
// Optional: try to detect the main lens (e.g., avoid ultrawide or telephoto)
const mainCamera = videoDevices.find(device =>
device.label.toLowerCase().includes("back") ||
device.label.toLowerCase().includes("rear")
);

const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
video: { deviceId: mainCamera?.deviceId }
});

**Caveat**: This only works if the browser exposes labels and multiple devices ‚Äî sometimes these labels are generic or permissions are too limited.

3. ### **Set Ideal Zoom or FOV Constraints (Experimental)**
There's **experimental support** in Chrome for zoom constraints using the `advanced` constraints list ‚Äî but it's not reliable across devices.

```javascript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    facingMode: "environment",
    advanced: [{ zoom: 1.0 }] // Some devices support this
  }
});
‚úÖ Use track.getCapabilities() and track.applyConstraints() for more precise zoom control (if supported):

javascript
Copy
Edit
const [track] = stream.getVideoTracks();
const capabilities = track.getCapabilities();

if (capabilities.zoom) {
  await track.applyConstraints({ advanced: [{ zoom: 2.0 }] }); // Try 2x zoom
}
‚ùó Warning: zoom is not universally supported on mobile browsers. It's often ignored unless the device/browser combination allows it.

üîß Alternative Approaches
Use a PWA (Progressive Web App) with Extra Permissions
Installable PWAs can sometimes get better access to device APIs, but they still don't override camera lens choices on all phones.

Prompt User to Pinch-Zoom Manually
Not ideal UX, but you can give users instructions or show a zoom slider on supported devices (e.g. via MediaTrackSettings.zoom).

Native App Wrapper (e.g., via Cordova, Capacitor, or React Native)
If camera control is crucial (especially lens selection and zoom), consider wrapping the app in a native shell. With that, you gain full camera control.

üî¨ Summary
Method	Zoom Control	Lens Selection	Browser Support
facingMode: environment	‚ùå	‚ùì Rear lens, often wide	‚úÖ All
deviceId	‚ùå	‚úÖ Possibly main lens	‚úÖ Most
zoom constraint / applyConstraints()	‚úÖ (if supported)	‚ùå	‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (some Samsung models)
Native wrapper (Capacitor, etc.)	‚úÖ Full	‚úÖ Full	‚úÖ (with app install)

If you're building barcode scanning functionality and want high reliability across devices, I‚Äôd recommend:

Try deviceId enumeration first.

Test if zoom can be set dynamically via applyConstraints().

Fallback to user guidance if it fails (or consider native camera handling via Cordova/Capacitor if it's critical).
